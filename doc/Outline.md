# Task

Our task is to make a game that utilizes multi-functional mechanics for USU's 2024 Hackathon.

## Brief Summary of Game

After brain storming we came up with the idea to make a game where the user is a mortuaries assistant. As the user/player they have to fill out forms at the start of their shift until there are none left. 

But as they are doing so the dead are rising and trying to get to the player and distract them. So to prevent you from being distracted the player must scrounge around and find items that are used to repel the ghosts. 

All while trying to finish filling out forms before their shift ends.

# Game Loop

The game will start with a small tutorial to get the player introduced to the mechanics.

The player wins when they finish all the paper work.

# Specifics

## Style

* "Fixed" viewpoint in 3d using sprites.
  * Using the Godot engine.
  * The player will be able to turn to different walls that serve a different purpose each.

## Mechanics

The main mechanic that the player will be using is typing. The player will type to fill out forms, send emails, and get rid of the corpse's / ghosts (appearing at random times).Fixed

* Forms (You will have to go to the ghosts to collect information)
  * Contain a number (or numbers) that relate to a ghost
  * Fill out
    * Name (type)
    * Cause of death (list to choose from)
    * Time of death (click on calendar)
    * Next of kin (type)

* Ghosts (8-10)
  * They are numbered to make it easy to find
  * They will all have different attributes
  * And some will have different "tasks" for you
